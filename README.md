### Complete the REST API

Add the missing endpoints to complete the REST API for products:

In the [App](/app.js) file:
1. Add a `POST` endpoint that adds a product to our list
2. Add a `GET` endpoint under `/product-list` to fetch a list of products
3. Add a `PUT` endpoint to update products using their `ID`
4. Add a `DELETE` endpoint with the path `/products/:productId` to delete products by their `ID`

#### Hint: You can check your progress by running: 

`npm test`
